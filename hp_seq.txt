This file contains some example HP chains.
Remember that terminals usually require CTRL+SHIFT+V instead of just CTRL+V to paste.

Standard chain from the lab manual

A toy chain that is very difficult to optimise (minimum energy is -42, if you get below -30 you're doing very well)

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (a true challenge for the program)

To make your own, look up the protein of your choice in a database online, and then convert it to the HP model. On Linux and Mac, you can do this in the terminal by running

echo "your-sequence-here" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr '[acfgilmpuvw]' 'H' | tr '[dehknoqrsty]' 'P'

which replaces each real amino acid with it closest HP approximation ("tr" stands for "text-replace"). You can of course achieve the same in an editor using find/replace. Note that you must convert to lowercase first, since the real amino acid h (histidine) is P and p (proline) is H. Inconvenient, huh?
